## code.fun.do 2018 - south regional round

#### >> Smoking scenes in movies generally come with warning texts, such as "Smoking is injurious to health".
#### >> These scenes are generally flagged manually, i.e people are made to watch the entire movie and mark scenes of interest.
#### >> AMCAD aims to automate this process, by using a combination of Neural Networks and Computer Vision techniques to identify these scenes and automatically add this warning text.
